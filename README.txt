At ISAE-SUPAERO, I had the chance to manage a team of students to work on the SOLO project. 
This project has been realized with 5 students of my promotion. It consists in building and programming an exemplary of the
quadruped robot SOLO, which is an open-source project available online. This robot has been thought to be accessible, cheap 
and easy to build and use for research and teaching purposes. Our project fits precisely into this framework, since it 
consists in providing a functional robotic tool to the LAAS-CNRS lab within 6 months, in parallel with our studies at ISAE-
SUPAERO. The project, therefore, has both a strong mechanical component in the construction of the robot, but also a large 
software component, since we both had to control the robot and to allow it to walk. To do this, we used a genetic algorithm to
develop different gaits.

The work we realized is available at these adresses :
  - simulation of the robot : https://github.com/EtienneAr/ISAE-PIE-quadruped-solo_pybullet.git
  - control of the robot : https://github.com/EtienneAr/ISAE-PIE-quadruped-solo.git
